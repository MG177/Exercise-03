        <h2>Ethereum<hr></h2>
        <p><b>Ethereum</b> is a decentralized, open-source <a href="Blockchain.html" title="Blockchain">blockchain</a> with smart contract functionality. <b>Ether</b> (<b>ETH</b> or <b>Îž</b>) is the native <a href=Cryptocurrency.html"" title="Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> of the platform. After <a href="Bitcoin.html" title="Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>, it is the second-largest <a href="Cryptocurrency.html" title="Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> by market capitalization. Ethereum is the most actively used <a href="Blockchain.html" title="Blockchain">blockchain</a>.
        </p><p>Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. In 2014, development was crowdfunded, and the network went live with an initial supply of 72 million coins on 30 July 2015. The platform allows developers to build and operate decentralized applications that users can interact with. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial intermediaries, such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks, allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out for interest. Ethereum also allows for the creation and exchange of <a href="NFT.html" title="Non-fungible token">NFTs</a>, which are non-interchangeable tokens connected to digital works of art or other real-world items and sold as unique digital property. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies operate as ERC-20 tokens on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for initial coin offerings.
        </p><p>Ethereum has started implementing a series of upgrades called Ethereum 2.0, which includes a transition to proof of stake and aims to increase transaction throughput using sharding.
